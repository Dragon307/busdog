	* filter/busdog.inx: fix wdf section in inf

	* gui/busdog/DriverManagement.cs: call wdf coinstaller in conjunction with
	dpinst so that wdf (which the driver relies on) will be installed

	* gui/busdog/MainForm.cs (InstallDriver, UninstallDriver): show user
	reason why driver installation/uninstallation failed
