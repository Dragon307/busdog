At the moment I still havent got a decent method of installing the busdog filter yet.

Current method is as follows:

1. Use OSR Driver Loader (http://www.osronline.com/article.cfm?article=157) to install the busdog service
2. Use the console app to attach busdog to the device you are interested in
3. Inspect the IRP_MJ_READ info from busdog in DebugView (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx)
